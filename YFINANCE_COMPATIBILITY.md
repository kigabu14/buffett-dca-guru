# Yahoo Finance yfinance Compatibility Update

This document explains the updates made to ensure compatibility with modern Yahoo Finance data access patterns, inspired by the approach taken in yfinance library updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Python yfinance Service

**Files Added:**
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies including latest stable yfinance
- `python_service/stock_data_service.py` - Python service using yfinance library
- `setup_python_service.sh` - Setup script for Python environment

**Purpose:**
The Python service provides a reliable fallback mechanism using the yfinance library, which handles Yahoo Finance API changes, rate limiting, and data normalization better than direct API calls.

### 2. Enhanced TypeScript Error Handling

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/stock-data/index.ts`

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
- Better data validation to catch API structure changes
- Fallback mechanism architecture (ready for Python service integration)
- More resilient HTTP error handling

## Architecture

```
Frontend Request → TypeScript Edge Function → Yahoo Finance Direct API
                                          ↓ (if fails)
                                   Python yfinance Service (fallback)
                                          ↓ (if fails)
                                   Static fallback data
```

## About yfinance "2.0.0"

**Note:** The original requirement mentioned `yfinance==2.0.0`, but this version doesn't exist. The yfinance library currently uses a 0.x.x versioning scheme with the latest stable version being 0.2.x.

This implementation uses the latest stable yfinance version (`>=0.2.60`) which includes:
- Improved error handling
- Better rate limiting
- Enhanced data validation
- More robust API change handling

## Usage

### Python Service (Standalone)

```bash
# Setup
./setup_python_service.sh

# Usage
python3 python_service/stock_data_service.py AAPL MSFT GOOGL
python3 python_service/stock_data_service.py PTT.BK BBL.BK  # Thai stocks
```

### Integration with Existing System

The TypeScript Edge Functions automatically attempt to use the Python service as a fallback when direct API calls fail. In production, you would:

1. Deploy the Python service as a microservice or Lambda function
2. Update the `fetchFromPythonService` function in `stock-data/index.ts` to call the deployed service
3. Configure environment variables for the Python service endpoint

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: yfinance library handles API changes and rate limiting
2. **Compatibility**: Future-proof against Yahoo Finance API changes
3. **Fallback**: Multiple data sources ensure service availability
4. **Minimal Changes**: Existing functionality preserved with enhanced error handling

## Testing

The system can be tested with:

```bash
# Test Python service directly
python3 python_service/stock_data_service.py AAPL

# Test TypeScript functions (requires Supabase CLI)
supabase functions serve
```

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to existing API
- Python service is optional but recommended for production
- All existing data structures and response formats preserved
- Enhanced error messages provide better debugging information
