# Yahoo Finance API Compatibility Update - yfinance 2.0.0

## Overview

This update enhances the Yahoo Finance API integration to be compatible with the data structures and reliability standards of `yfinance` 2.0.0. While the application doesn't directly use the `yfinance` Python library, it implements the same improved practices for data fetching and error handling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Added robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Better handling of rate limiting (HTTP 429) responses
- Improved error recovery for temporary network issues
- Maximum 3 retry attempts with intelligent wait times

### 2. Updated API Endpoints and Headers
- Enhanced request headers for better reliability
- Updated endpoint URLs for consistency
- Added timeout configuration (15 seconds)
- Better User-Agent strings to avoid blocking

### 3. Improved Data Structure Consistency
- Enhanced fallback data generation for failed API calls
- Better handling of different market formats (US, Thai, Canadian, UK)
- More robust data parsing with null-safe operations
- Improved dividend date formatting

### 4. Enhanced Market Support
- Better detection and handling of different stock exchanges:
  - Thai stocks (.BK, .SET) - SET market, THB currency
  - Canadian stocks (.TO, .TSE) - TSX market, CAD currency
  - UK stocks (.L, .LON) - LSE market, GBP currency
  - US stocks - NASDAQ/NYSE market, USD currency

### 5. Better Rate Limiting
- Reduced concurrent requests from 3 to 2
- Increased delay between batches from 1000ms to 1500ms
- Added progressive retry delays to avoid overwhelming APIs

## Files Updated

### Supabase Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/stock-data/index.ts`)
- Added `fetchWithRetry()` function with intelligent retry logic
- Enhanced `parseComprehensiveData()` with better error handling
- Improved `createFallbackData()` with market-specific defaults
- Added additional Yahoo Finance modules for better data coverage

### Frontend Service (`/src/services/YahooFinanceService.ts`)
- Enhanced data validation in `getStock()` and `getStocks()` methods
- Better handling of failed API responses with fallback data
- Improved data mapping from API response to frontend interface
- Added `isSampleData` flag to indicate when fallback data is used

## Compatibility Notes

These changes ensure the application continues to work reliably with Yahoo Finance APIs while implementing the same best practices that `yfinance` 2.0.0 uses for data fetching and error handling.

## Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ Enhanced error handling works correctly
- ✅ Fallback data generation for different markets
- ✅ Improved retry logic for failed requests
- ✅ Better rate limiting to avoid API blocks

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Historical data caching for better performance
- WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Additional financial metrics from supplementary APIs
- User-configurable retry and timeout settings
